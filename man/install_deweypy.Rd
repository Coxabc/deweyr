\title{Install the deweypy Python Package}
\usage{
install_deweypy(upgrade = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{upgrade}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, upgrades deweypy to the latest version
if it is already installed. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the exit status of the installation command.
A return value of \code{0} indicates successful installation.
}
\description{
Installs the \code{deweypy} Python package using pip. This function locates the
Python executable and installs deweypy into the Python environment.
}
\details{
This function uses \code{system2()} to call pip via the Python executable found
by \code{find_python()}. The installation is performed using the command:
\code{python -m pip install deweypy}

If the installation fails, check that:
\itemize{
\item Python is properly installed and accessible
\item pip is installed in your Python environment
\item You have the necessary permissions to install Python packages
}
}
\note{
This function assumes that \code{find_python()} is available and returns a valid
path to a Python executable. The Python environment used will depend on the
implementation of \code{find_python()}.
