This function automatically detects the operating system and uses the appropriate
installation method:

\item \strong{Linux/macOS}: Uses curl to download and execute the shell script
}

The function will skip installation if UV is already available on the system PATH.

\note{
\itemize{
\item On Windows, this requires PowerShell execution policy to allow script execution
\item On Linux/macOS, this requires curl to be installed
\item If automatic installation fails, users should install UV manually from
